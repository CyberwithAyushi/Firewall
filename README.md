# Firewall
A project showcasing network topology setup, firewall configurations, Zero-Trust security implementation, and advanced NGFW feature configuration.

## Objective
I designed and implemented a secure network architecture using Palo Alto NGFW. The project emphasized Zero Trust security, advanced threat detection, and real-time traffic monitoring. This experience enhanced my expertise in firewall rule configuration, exploit prevention, and strengthening overall network security defenses.

## Key Takeaways from the Project
ðŸ”¹ Zero-Trust Implementation: Gained hands-on experience in isolating network entities and enforcing strict security controls to limit unauthorized access.

ðŸ”¹ Advanced Firewall Configuration: Developed skills in configuring Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) features, including application awareness, HTTPS inspection, URL filtering, and antivirus inspection.

ðŸ”¹ Threat Detection and Mitigation: Successfully simulated, detected, and blocked real-world cyberattacks like MS17-010 exploitation using Metasploit and PAN-OS IPS modules.

ðŸ”¹ Security Analysis: Enhanced ability to analyze traffic logs, monitor deny events, and refine security policies to prevent potential attacks while maintaining service accessibility.

ðŸ”¹ Practical Problem-Solving: Strengthened analytical skills by resolving access issues, testing security configurations, and validating the effectiveness of security mechanisms.
